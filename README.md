# SQLMap Launcher

A lightweight **GUI launcher / wrapper for sqlmap**, designed to improve usability while preserving sqlmap’s original command-line behavior.

This project does **not modify sqlmap itself**.  
It provides a graphical frontend for configuring common parameters, previewing the generated command, and monitoring real-time output.
